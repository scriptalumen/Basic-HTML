#What is JSFiddle?
JSFiddle serves as a versatile platform tailored for web development enthusiasts at all skill levels.
It's an online tool that facilitates experimentation with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
The real-time feedback feature allows you to observe the effects of your code modifications instantly.

##The steps to use "[JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/)" are as follows:
1. The HTML area is where you type all the HTML tags and text of the web page.
2. The CSS area is where you type all the CSS styling information.
3. The JavaScript area is where you type the JavaScript code to make your web page interactive.
4. The preview area is where your web page is displayed like a web browser.
5. The most important thing for you is the "Run" button. Whenever you make a change in any area, you must click the "Run" button to refresh the preview area.


###Note: 
To simplify things for students, CSS and JavaScript code snippets are included within the HTML code. If desired, you can extract the relevant portion of the HTML code that references the CSS and JavaScript files. Uncomment it and incorporate it into your project.
