What is JSFiddle?
JSFiddle is an environment for both beginners and experienced web developers.
This online web application allows anyone to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
As you make changes, you can see the impact of those changes live.

The steps to use "JSFiddle" are as follows:
1. The HTML area is where you type all the HTML tags and text of the web page.
2. The CSS area is where you type all the CSS styling information.
3. The JavaScript area is where you type the JavaScript code to make your web page interactive.
4. The preview area is where your web page is displayed like a web browser.
5. The most important thing for you is the "Run" button. Whenever you make a change in any area, you must click the "Run" button to refresh the preview area.
